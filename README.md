# learning-python
I am trying to improve my skills in Python and upload my process in this repo.
Why?
- I want to track my process.
- I want to make an indepth collection of different parts of Python, so you and I can come back to these files to better understand something.
- I do think that most "help pages" for Python are inadequate or not easy to understand.
- I want to force myself to not stop learning until I have a great foundation in Python.
I hope you enjoy following my journey as much as I will :)
